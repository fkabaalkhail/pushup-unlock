# PushUp Unlock

## 📱 About
PushUp Unlock is my very first iOS app project.  
The idea is simple: instead of instantly using your phone, you’ll have to **do push-ups** to unlock access to your apps.  

This project is a mix of fitness, productivity, and fun — and it’s also my way of learning how to code, work with Git, and publish an app on the Apple App Store.

This is my first project as an Apple Developer. 🚀

## 🚀 Features (Planned)
- Detect push-ups using the **iPhone’s motion sensors**.
- Optional **camera mode** with AI pose detection for accuracy.
- **Customizable goals** (choose how many push-ups you need).
- **Emergency whitelist** (always allow SOS, Phone, and essential apps).
- **Progress tracking** (history, streaks, achievements).
- **Privacy-first** (all detection happens on-device).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Platform:** iOS (Swift, SwiftUI)  
- **Motion Detection:** Core Motion framework  
- **AI Pose Detection:** TensorFlow Lite / MediaPipe  
- **App Restrictions:** Screen Time / FamilyControls API  
- **UI Design:** SwiftUI  

## 🎯 Roadmap
1. Create a basic “Hello World” app (Swift + SwiftUI).
2. Build a simple “Do 5 push-ups to continue” screen.
3. Add Core Motion push-up detection.
4. Implement app blocking with Screen Time API.
5. Add camera pose detection as an optional mode.
6. Track reps, streaks, and daily goals.
7. Polish UI, write Privacy Policy, and publish to App Store.
